# Pixellayer

Image stitching and video stitching are the techniques to solve the problem of overlapping fields of view in images and videos using AI technologies. The creations of panoramic images using computer vision are primarily focused on creating panoramas using a library of images. The basic idea of this tool is to propose a suitable method to meet the needs of stitching two or more images and further generate a 360 degree visualization of that stitched image. This method performs stitching of real-time images using live cameras. Proposed approach ‘Pixellayer’ also removes the usage of a wide-angle camera for stitching which makes this approach efficient in terms of cost. It includes the feature of frames per second and captures the live movement of an object in a real-time environment. It also solves the problem of blind spots of security cameras and creating cinematic effects. My algorithm is providing solution for the following problems:

->To provide a cost-effective way to avoid whitespace of the frame captured by the cameras.

->To provide a real time video stitching using wireless cameras

->The main motive of real-time video stitching is to create a seamless and complete panoramic view from multiple video streams captured by different cameras in real-time. This technology has numerous applications in fields such as virtual reality, surveillance, video conferencing, live broadcasting, and more. The goal is to provide a continuous and smooth viewing experience for the user without any visible seams or disruptions in the video.
